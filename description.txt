Question 1
Armstrong
Context An Armstrong number of 3 digits is an integer that the sum of the cubes of its digits is
equal to the number
Task Write a code to check whether an integer is Armstrong number or not.
E.g
371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371
UI Design The App should have an input field which takes in the number to be checked, a button to
run check and a div to display the result. If the number is not a 3 digit integer, the button
should be deactivated and if the user tries to click on it while deactivated, a message
should appear explaining why the button canâ€™t be clicked.
